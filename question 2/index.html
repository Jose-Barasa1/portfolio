  <h1>Communication Protocols in Web Design</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>Section 1: HTTP vs HTTPS</h2>
    <p>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication for the web. HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is an encrypted version of HTTP that ensures secure data transmission between the client and server. The 'S' in HTTPS stands for 'Secure' and uses SSL/TLS encryption to protect sensitive information like login credentials, personal data, and payment details.</p>

          <th>Feature</th>

          <th>HTTPS</th>
        </tr>

          <td>SEO Advantage</td>
          <td>No boost</td>

    <h2>Section 2: FTP and SFTP</h2>
    <p>FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is used to transfer files between a client and a server. SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) is a more secure alternative that adds encryption over SSH (Secure Shell). While FTP is faster and simpler, SFTP is preferred when transmitting sensitive or private data due to its secure nature.</p>

  <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Secure communication protocols like HTTPS and SFTP play a vital role in modern web design. They ensure the privacy and integrity of data, build user trust, and protect systems from malicious attacks. Whether you're transferring files or displaying a webpage, security should always be a priority.</p>
